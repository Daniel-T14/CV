    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p class="profile-text">I am a Computer Science graduate from UW–Madison with aspirations in network architecture and software development. I have a broad range of project and classroom experience that demonstrates my knowledge in neural network development, the Software Development Life Cycle, and various web development skills. I am driven to create high-quality user experiences through products with effective and communicative features.</p>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <div class="education-header">Bachelor of Science, Computer Science</div>
    <div class="education-school">University of Wisconsin–Madison</div>
    <div class="education-dates">August 2020 – May 2025</div>
    <p>My academic journey has encompassed relevant coursework including UI/UX Design & Development, Cryptography, Introduction to Algorithms, Software Engineering, Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks, and Introduction to Operating Systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Employment History</h2>
    <div class="job-title">Technology Support Engineer and Assistant Admin</div>
    <div class="company-location">The Gordon Flesch Company (GFC), Madison</div>
    <div class="date-range">May 2023 – Present</div>
    <p>At the GFC I provide Level 1 technical support for the largest office equipment provider in the Midwest. This role has deepened my knowledge in IT and infrastructure through hands-on work with complex network solutions. It has also introduced me to more user-focused problem-solving approaches, distinct from those in academic settings.</p>
    
    <div class="job-title">Bartender / Catering Assistant</div>
    <div class="company-location">The Pyle Center, Madison</div>
    <div class="date-range">June 2022 – May 2023</div>
    <p>As a catering assistant, I led team efforts, built rapport with clients, and developed strong communication and time-management skills in a high-paced environment. In my role as a bartender, I managed work orders and scheduling while adapting to fluctuating inventory levels and fast-changing demands.</p>
    
    <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
    <div class="project-title">Team Nine Lives – Software Development, Class 506</div>
    <p>I worked in a six-member team to emulate a professional development environment. We applied SCRUM, SOLID principles, and various agile methodologies to develop a vending machine management system for both mobile and web platforms. The project also involved building a fully functional vending machine networked to the UW Madison CAN cloud where we hosted our docker services.</p>
    
    <div class="project-title">Super-Resolution Adversarial Network – Introduction to Neural Networks, Class 539</div>
    <p>I collaborated in a team of four to recreate the 2017 paper titled "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)." We designed and implemented a generator, discriminator, and GAN architecture based on convolutional neural networks. The project culminated in multiple presentations, status reports, and a comprehensive 16-page research paper outlining our process and findings.</p>
    
    <div class="project-title">Adoption Center – UI/UX Design, Class 571</div>
    <p>This project involved designing and developing a responsive website for the Madison Cat Project using React.js, Next.js, REST APIs, GitLab, Vite, Bootstrap, and other front-end tools. The application allows users to browse shelter cats, learn about the organization, and manage an adoption basket for interviews. Custom React components were used to create an interactive adoption process and dynamic UI.</p>
    
    <div class="project-title">Grocery and Chatroom Agents – UI/UX Design, Class 574</div>
    <p>I developed two AI-based applications to replace traditional interfaces. The first, a Grocery Agent, enables users to search for items, manage their carts, and complete checkout through conversational AI. The second, a Chatroom Agent, supports user navigation, account setup, and message handling using an AI-trained interface. Both applications were built using Vite, React.js, React Native, REST APIs, and custom AI response training.</p>
    
    <h2>Current Activities</h2>
    <div class="course-title">Udemy Course: CompTIA Network+ 10-009 Exam Prep</div>
    <p>Working in IT has made me aware of certain infrastructure knowledge gaps I possess. To amend this I am studying to complete the CompTIA Network+ certification. Laying the groundwork for further certifications that will bridge the proverbial divide I have between the infrastructure and software ends.</p>
    
    <div class="course-title">Proxmox Computing Cluster</div>
    <p>Currently I am building a networked lab that will provide me with a single interface point to the computational resources of four devices. Creating a distributed environment that allows for the allocation and movement of computational demand across the network. Providing continuous service for future research and projects. Essentially this is an exercise in implementing cloud services from the ground up for a virtual computer lab. Providing experience in network implementation, virtualization, and service provision.</p>
